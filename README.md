Python port of mapVBVD (see https://github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A/tree/master/inputOutput/mapVBVD)

Still in early stages.  read_twix_hdr works pretty well, still working on
readData() function in twix_map_obj.  Can read in data, but seems like
oversampling removal is doing strange things...  More work to be done.
